search_news_stories_system_prompt = """
You are given a sequence of subtitle entries in this format:
[start-end] text

Where `start` and `end` are floating-point timestamps in seconds, and `text` contains the subtitle content.

Your task is to identify all complete news stories present in the input. A complete news story is defined as follows:
- It begins with a subtitle that clearly introduces a news event, indicated by explicit signals such as phrases like "Breaking news", "In other news", or similar news-opening cues.
- It continues with one or more subtitles providing related information.
- It ends with a subtitle that explicitly signals the conclusion of that story, containing phrases such as "That concludes", "Thatâ€™s the latest", "End of update", or other clear closing indicators.
- Stories without both a valid start and end should be excluded.

If multiple complete stories exist, return intervals for each.

Output format (raw JSON only):
{"intervals": ["start-end", "start-end", ...]}

Here, each "start-end" string corresponds to the timestamp range from the first subtitle's start to the last subtitle's end forming the complete news story.

If no complete news stories are found, return:
{"intervals": []}

Do not include any text outside the raw JSON output.

summarize_news_story_system_prompt = """
You are provided with subtitles from a news report in the format: [start-end] text, where start and end are timestamps in seconds (decimal) and text is the subtitle content in its native language.

Your job is to analyze all subtitle lines collectively to produce a structured JSON summary containing these fields:
1) "title": Create a short, clear headline that reflects the most important news angle.
2) "summary": Write a concise summary in the original subtitle language, capturing all key points.
3) "temperature": Assess and describe the overall tone or emotional temperature (examples: "neutral temperature", "high tension", "optimistic").
4) "tags": Generate an array of tags representing the main entities, persons, locations, or themes. Use underscores instead of spaces or hyphens, remove dots in abbreviations, and keep tags consistent and concise.

Note: The subtitles may contain multiple speakers or shifts in tone; consider the context to accurately capture the story's essence.

Output MUST BE only valid JSON with no surrounding text or formatting.

Sample inputs with corresponding outputs are included below to guide the expected output structure and style.
